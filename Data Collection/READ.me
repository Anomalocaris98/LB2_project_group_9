# Data Collection

This folder contains the scripts, notebooks, and datasets used to retrieve, cluster, and organize protein sequences from UniProtKB for signal peptide prediction.

---

## Overview

The goal of this stage is to:
- Retrieve positive and negative protein datasets from UniProtKB.
- Perform redundancy reduction using MMseqs2 clustering.
- Extract representative sequences for downstream preprocessing and model training.

## Folder Contents

### data_gathering.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook responsible for collecting data from UniProtKB and creating the first datasets.

**Main workflow:**
- Queries UniProtKB for proteins with and without signal peptides.
- Filters incomplete or ambiguous entries.
- Saves datasets in `.tsv` and `.fasta` formats.
- Prepares data for MMseqs2 clustering.

[Open data_gathering.ipynb](./data_gathering.ipynb)

### extract_rep.py
Python script that extracts representative sequences from MMseqs2 clustering results.

**What it does:**
- Reads the `.tsv` file output from MMseqs2.
- Extracts only the representative sequence IDs.
- Removes duplicates and saves the cleaned IDs in a new file.

**Example usage:**
```bash
python extract_rep.py
# Input: positive_cluster.tsv
# Output: positive_output_rep.tsv
